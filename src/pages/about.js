            Ever since I was a child, I had an insatiable hunger for
            knowledge. I wanted to learn everything about everything and
            nothing could stop me. I can still recall the nights I was under
            the blankets, perched over encyclopedias with a flashlight in my
            hand.

          <p>
            The quest for knowledge is one that I still pursue. Whether Iâ€™m
            watching a movie and trying to understand more about the cinematography
            or wondering how users will use a feature, Iâ€™m always seeking 
            information that I can combine in unique ways.

            The endless curiosity eventually led me to the&nbsp;

            , where I studied Biology, and specialized in Bioinformatics, Psychology
            and Entrepreneurship.

            Studying science taught me to be analytical. It wasn't clear immediately 
            but it also introduced me to design as a process. Learning about 
            biological concepts, such as&nbsp;

            , made me appreciate design in its most natural form.

          <p>
            As a designer, I aim to explore new technological frontiers and practice 
            holistic design, especially to create social impact. Developing good 
            product sense as a product designer in all my design involvements taught 
            me how to do so.

            My eagerness for novelty also extends to my hobbies. In my free time, I 
            like to read and watch films. I'd never pass on the opportunity to binge 
            through a couple of books and movies. You can also find me at the gym,&nbsp;
