            Ever since I was a child, I had an insatiable hunger for
            knowledge. I wanted to learn everything about everything and
            nothing could stop me. I can still recall the nights I was under
            the blankets, perched over encyclopedias with a flashlight in my
            hand.

          <p>
            The quest for knowledge is one that I still pursue. Whether Iâ€™m
            watching a movie and trying to understand why a scene was
            crafted a certain way or wondering how users will use a feature,
            Iâ€™m always seeking information that I can combine in unique
            ways.

            The endless curiosity eventually led me to the&nbsp;

            , where I graduated from with a degree in Biology, along with
            specializations in Bioinformatics, Psychology and
            Entrepreneurship.

            Studying science taught me to be analytical and purposeful with
            my process and while it wasn't clear immediately, it also
            introduced me to the world of design. Hours of learning about
            biological principles, such as&nbsp;

            As a product designer, I aim to explore new technological
            frontiers and design for systems holistically, especially to
            create meaningful social impact. Developing good product sense
            as a principle designer at both&nbsp;

            My eagerness for novelty also extends to my hobbies. In my free
            time, I like to read non-fiction, especially on history and
            anthropology. Watching films is my second love; I'd never pass
            on the opportunity to binge through a couple of movies. You can
            also find me playing squash with friends,&nbsp;
