                            <p>Ever since I was a child, I had an insatiable hunger for knowledge. I wanted to learn everything about everything and nothing could 
                                stop me. I can still recall the nights I was under the blankets, perched over encyclopedias with a flashlight in my hand.</p>
                            <p>The quest for knowledge is one that I still pursue. Whether Iâ€™m watching a movie and trying to understand why a scene was crafted 
                                a certain way or wondering how users will use a feature, Iâ€™m always seeking information that I can combine in unique ways.</p>
                            <p>The endless curiosity eventually led me to the&nbsp;
                                <InlineLink link="https://uwaterloo.ca/" link_text="University of Waterloo" destination="uwaterloo.ca" /> 
                                , where I graduated from with a degree in Biology, along with specializations in Bioinformatics, Psychology and Entrepreneurship.</p>
                            <p>Studying science taught me to be analytical and purposeful with my process and while it wasn't clear immediately, it had also 
                                introduced me to the world of design. Hours of learning about biological principles, such as&nbsp;
                                <InlineLink link="https://www.cracked.com/article_20368_the-6-coolest-survival-traits-designed-by-evolution.html" 
                                link_text="how evolution guides complexity" destination="cracked.com" />, led to an appreciation for design in its most natural form.</p>
                            <p>As a product designer, I enjoy working at the intersection of ideation, design and engineering. I believe that designing for systems
                                holistically leads to great outcomes. Developing good product sense as a principle designer at both&nbsp; 
                                <InlineLink link="https://prospr.cc/" link_text="my startup" destination="prospr.cc" /> and my recent stint at&nbsp; 
                                <InlineLink link="https://vendorpm.com/" link_text="VendorPM" destination="vendorpm.com" /> has taught me how to properly balance 
                                business objectives and engineering constraints as I relentlessly champion the user.</p>
                            <p>My eagerness for novelty also extends to my hobbies. In my free time, I like to read non-fiction, especially on history and 
                                anthropology. The past fascinates me, with books sharing the experiences of others throughout time. Watching films is my second 
                                love; I'd never pass on the opportunity to pick up popcorn and binge through a couple of movies. I also enjoy playing squash 
                                with friends and figuring out how my camera works.</p>
