                        <p className="about_bio_content">Ever since I was a child, I had an insatiable hunger for knowledge. I wanted to learn everything
                        about everything and nothing could stop me on my quest. I can still vividly remember the many nights I was under the blankets, 
                        perched over an encyclopedia with a flashlight in my hand.</p>
                        <p className="about_bio_content">The quest for knowledge is something that I still relentlessly pursue.</p>
                        <p className="about_bio_content">As a product designer, I enjoy working at the intersection of ideation, design and engineering. I believe
                        that designing for systems holistically, rather than individual services, leads to great outcomes. Developing good product sense as a principle 
                        designer in both <a href="https://prospr.cc/">my own startup</a> and my recent work stint at <a href="https://vendorpm.com/">VendorPM</a> has 
                        taught me how to properly balance business objectives and engineering constraints as I champion for the user, all with the aim to build the best 
                        possible products.</p>
                        <p className="about_bio_content">I graduated from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> with a degree in Biology and specializations 
                        in Bioinformatics, Psychology and Entrepreneurship. Everything I learned can be summed up in one line - the mitochondrion is the powerhouse of the cell.</p>
                        <p className="about_bio_content">Jokes aside, studying science taught me a lot about being data-driven in my process. While I didnâ€™t realize 
                        it immediately, learning biology opened my eyes to the world of design. Countless hours of memorizing different features of various
                        organisms and <a href="https://www.cracked.com/article_20368_the-6-coolest-survival-traits-designed-by-evolution.html">how they're optimized for 
                        maximum survival</a> turned the frustration of studying into fascination.</p>
